General Information
Title: Wildlife under global change (WS, 3 SWS, 3.5 ECTS)
Course type: Prüfungsimminent (PI) – see Richtlinie_pruefungsimmanente_Lehrveranstaltungen-3.pdf
Lecturer: B. Mattsson, OEKB-WILD
Reason for introducing course
Students in the Master programme Wildlife Ecology and Wildlife Management (UH 066 223) are exposed to scientific work including quantitative analysis in several courses within this curriculum. Lacking however is a course where students are guided in carrying out the scientific method in its entirety by themselves, including statistical analysis to examine a research question involving interannual changes in wildlife populations over time based on existing data.  By developing a semester project on understanding how wildlife demographics associate with changes in climate and land cover, they apply the scientific method to a real-world case that can provide a solid basis for a high-quality thesis or internship.  Several students have expressed strong interest in such a course not only to support degree requirements but also to enhance their research skills going forward in their careers.
Course description
Content
Students prepare a semester project by working alone or with another student, supported by short lectures by the instructor on the scientific method and statistical analysis.  Each student or pair presents preliminary results from their work and addresses feedback from the instructor and other students.

Students learn about species distribution modeling using machine learning along with generalized linear mixed models using the Gaussian, binomial, and Poisson distributions.  Each pair of students develops a research question and hypotheses while focusing on a particular response variable like species richness, abundance, reproduction, and body condition. They then select the appropriate data to represent the response variable (e.g., number of species captured, count of individuals for a given species captured, number of young fledged, weight, clutch size, nestling success, nesting success).  For the response variable, they use existing data such as those managed by the Konrad Lorenz Institute of Ethology, eBird, GBIF, MAPS, or the North American Breeding Bird Survey.  They then regress the response variable with at least one covariate representing land cover (CORINE) and one representing weather.  When relevant, they incorporate as predictors intrinsic variables such as animal age or sex. The study sites should ideally represent a gradient from low to high human footprint with similar topography, soils, and elevation.

Previous knowledge expected

Students must have either taken the following courses or get approval from the instructor to demonstrate equivalent knowledge from other sources. Both of these: 832313 Basics in wildlife ecology; 851303 Advanced statistical methods for wildlife research.  One of these: 832309 Current contributions in wildlife research and wildlife management; 832333 Behavioural and population ecology.

Learning outcomes
Following this course, students understand the importance and theory of linking environmental changes to spatiotemporal patterns in wildlife communities and populations.  They also can generate and apply relevant research questions, hypotheses, and predictions, along with identifying and using appropriate statistical models and data sets within R Studio. Students gain skills in developing and giving oral presentations describing their investigation.
Teaching and learning method
Each session, except for the presentation sessions, begins with a 5-30 minute presentation by instructor on the focal topic or analytical step.  For the remaining time, pairs work on their semester project under guidance of the instructor and tutor.

Course criteria & registration

1 group, maximum 12 participants with waiting list, registration starts as soon as possible and ends 3 weeks after the first session.
Exam information
Assessment
Grade is based on presentation of the semester project.

Internal info (not to be included in form)
3-credit course (equivalent to 34.5 contact hours = 11.5 x 3-hr sessions), 9am-noon on Tuesdays in winter semester – overlaps only with Behavioral and Population Ecology, which is one of the recommended prerequisites.  The first session is mid-October, allowing for 2 weeks in October to prepare with the tutor.
Target group: Wildlife Master students in their 3rd or 4th semester.
Up to 8 students during the first year, working alone or in pairs.  Can increase the number of students in future if deemed feasible.

Draft syllabus:
1)	Course orientation, introduce semester project and pool of response variables (assigned readings)
2)	Develop research questions/hypotheses and choose appropriate response variable
3)	Write out statistical model representing each hypothesis along with hypothetical results as graphs
4)	Prepare data for analysis
5)	Run diagnostics on the global model to check assumptions
6)	Compare models using AIC(c) and examine predictions from best-performing model(s)
7)	Prepare presentations of preliminary results
8)	Present and discuss preliminary results, 30 minutes per group (15-20 minute presentation + 10-15 minute discussion)
9)	Revise analysis based on feedback
10)	Prepare presentations of final results
11)	Present and discuss final results, 30 minutes per group (15-20 minute presentation + 10-15 minute discussion)
